				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>FOSS stands for "Free and Open Source Software."
					 It is a term used to describe software that is released under a license that allows users to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software freely.
					  FOSS is often developed by a community of contributors who collaborate to improve the software.<br><br>

					The "free" in FOSS refers to the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software.
					 This does not necessarily mean that the software is available for free, but rather that users have the freedom to access and use it without restrictions.<br><br>
					
					The "open source" in FOSS refers to the fact that the source code of the software is made available to the public, which allows developers to study, modify, and distribute the software. 
					This also enables a community of contributors to collaborate on the development of the software, which can lead to improved functionality, security, and overall quality.<br>

				<h3>History of its development</h3>


				<p>The development of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) can be traced back to the early days of
					 computing. However, it was in the 1980s that the FOSS movement began to take shape,
					 and it was largely driven by the work of Richard Stallman and the GNU project.<br><br>

					Stallman had worked at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in the 1970s, 
					where he was part of a community of programmers who shared software and freely modified and 
					distributed it. In the early 1980s, he began to notice that proprietary software was becoming more 
					common, and that users were being restricted in their ability to modify and distribute software.<br><br>
					
					In 1983, Stallman launched the GNU project with the goal of creating a completely free and open
					 source operating system. The project aimed to provide a complete software ecosystem, including a
					  compiler, editor, and other tools, as well as an operating system kernel.<br><br>
					
					One of the key contributions of the GNU project was the creation of the GNU General Public License
					 (GPL), which provided a legal framework for distributing and modifying software while ensuring 
					 that the source code remained open and freely available.<br><br>
					
					In the 1990s, the Linux operating system kernel was created by Linus Torvalds and released under
					 the GPL. Linux quickly became popular, and was combined with the GNU tools to create a 
					 fully functional operating system.<br><br>
					
					The growth of the internet in the 1990s also played a major role in the development of FOSS. 
					Open source software became a popular way for developers to collaborate and share code,
					 and online forums and communities sprang up to support the development and distribution of FOSS.</p>

					 <h3>Benefits of FOSS over proprietary software</h3>

					 <p>There are many benefits of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
						 over proprietary software, including:
					</p>
					 <ul>
						<li>Cost:</li>
						<p> FOSS is often free or significantly less expensive than proprietary software.
							 This can be particularly beneficial for individuals, small businesses,
							 and organizations that cannot afford expensive proprietary software licenses.</p>
							
							 <li>Flexibility:</li>
							 <p> Since the source code for FOSS is openly available,
								 it can be modified and customized to meet specific needs. 
								 This flexibility allows users to adapt the software to their unique
								  requirements and develop new features.
							</p>
							<li>Security:</li>
							<p> FOSS is often considered to be more secure than proprietary 
								software, as the open nature of the code allows for community-driven peer
								 review and testing, which can identify and fix security vulnerabilities
								  quickly.
							</p>
							<li>Support:</li>
							<p> While proprietary software often requires users to pay
								 for support, FOSS communities are typically active and supportive, 
								 providing online forums, documentation, and user groups.
							</p>
							<li>Interoperability:</li>
							<p> FOSS is often developed using open standards and protocols,
								 which can improve interoperability with other software and systems.
							</p>
							<li>Continuity:</li>
							<p>Since the code for FOSS is openly available, there is less risk 
								of the software becoming obsolete or discontinued, as users can 
								continue to develop and maintain it.
							</p>
							<li>Transparency:</li>
							<p> FOSS is often developed in an open and transparent way,
								 which can promote trust and accountability, 
								as users can see how the software works and identify potential issues.
							</p>
					 </ul>
					 <p>Overall, the benefits of FOSS can make it an attractive choice for individuals,
						 businesses, and organizations of all sizes. While there may be some learning 
						 curve in transitioning to FOSS, the benefits can outweigh the effort required
						  to make the switch.</p>

						  <h3>Alternatives of FOSS to common application</h3>

						  <p>FOSS alternatives to commonly used applications:</p>

							<li><img src='libreoffice.jpg' height="70" width="70">LibreOffice - a FOSS alternative to Microsoft Office</li>
							<li><img src='gimp.jfif' height="70" width="70">GIMP - a FOSS alternative to Adobe Photoshop</li>
							<li><img src='inkscape.png' height="70" width="70">Inkscape - a FOSS alternative to Adobe Illustrator</li>
							<li><img src='audacity.png' height="70" width="70">Audacity - a FOSS alternative to Adobe Audition or GarageBand</li>
							<li><img src='blender.png' height="70" width="70">Blender - a FOSS alternative to Autodesk 3ds Max or Maya</li>
							<li><img src='vlcg.png' height="70" width="70">VLC - a FOSS alternative to Windows Media Player or QuickTime</li>
							<li><img src='firefox.png' height="70" width="70">Firefox - a FOSS alternative to Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge</li>
							<li><img src='krita.png' height="70" width="70">Krita - a FOSS alternative to Corel Painter or Adobe Photoshop</li>
							<li><img src='scribus.png' height="70" width="70">Scribus - a FOSS alternative to Adobe InDesign or Microsoft Publisher</li>
							<p>These FOSS alternatives are typically available on multiple operating systems,
							 including Windows, macOS, and Linux, and often have similar features and 
							 capabilities as their proprietary counterparts. Additionally, since they 
							 are released under open source licenses, users can access and modify the 
							 source code, and distribute modified versions of the software,
							which allows for greater flexibility and customization.</p>

							<h3>It's ties with GNU/Linux</h3>

							<p>FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) is a movement that promotes the use of software
								 that is distributed under a license that allows users to access and modify the source code,
								  and to distribute modified versions of the software.<br><br>

								GNU/Linux is an operating system that is built on top of the Linux kernel and a
								 collection of free software programs and tools that are part of the GNU project.
								  Many of the programs that are included in GNU/Linux distributions are released
								   under FOSS licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Apache License.<br><br>
								
								In fact, the development of GNU/Linux is closely tied to the FOSS movement.
								 The GNU project was launched in 1983 by Richard Stallman with the 
								 goal of creating a completely free and open source operating system.
								  In the 1990s, Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel and released it under the GPL, 
								  which allowed the Linux kernel to be combined with the GNU tools to create a 
								  fully-functional operating system.<br><br>
								
								Since then, GNU/Linux has become a popular operating system for servers, desktop computers,
								 and other computing devices. Many FOSS projects, such as the Apache web server, 
								 the MySQL database, and the PHP programming language, are commonly used on GNU/Linux systems.<br><br>
								
								The relationship between FOSS and GNU/Linux is therefore quite strong,
								 with many of the software programs and tools that are included in GNU/Linux 
								 distributions being released under FOSS licenses, and with the GNU project 
								 having played a major role in the development of the operating system.
